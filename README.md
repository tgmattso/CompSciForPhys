# Computer Science for Physicists

It's really quite simple.  Experimental physics depends on computers.  Connecting theory to data requires computers and numerical modeling.  Analyzing data requires computers.  Basically, computing is almost as fundamental to Physics as Math.

The problem is that physicists (and other scietists) are not formally taught computer science in school.  They are expected to just pick it up along the way.  And that is a problem.  They do indeed pick up quite a bit, but there are a numbrer of topics that get lost in the process.

This series of lectures are my attempt to put in one place the body of knowlege from computer science that Physicists (and other scientists) should know.
